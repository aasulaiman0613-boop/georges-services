            <p>Let’s be real. Trying to trade in <strong>Steal a Brainrot</strong> is a nightmare in public lobbies. You are basically just waiting to get scammed.</p>
            <p>We started this place because we wanted a spot where you can actually find legit trades without having to stress about every click. It is a community of people who actually play the game and want to keep the trading scene from being a total mess.</p>
